#Day 3
	
	The sands have changed their color. Red is a nice change of pace.
	
	I no longer like the color red, the ground gave out from under me.
	Thankfully I had my shovel to keep myself from sufficating.
	Such a misleading name. Quicksand leading to what could've been a Slow Death.
	
	I found another pyramid on my journey. This one in much better condition than the last.
	With the memory of the last time I approached one of these fresh in my mind, I decided to carry on past it.
	
	Finally! Something that isn't sand. Albeit, I found stone covering the surface of this new found land.
	Not many crops would grow here I reckon.
	
	This land holds nothing but false promises and ruins.
	Every group of trees I find is a mere sliver with the idea of dirt underneith it.
	At this point I am willing to settle on any wooded land.
	But all that is here is sand, depression, and sand.
	
	And Pyramids. I found another.
	
	I see some smoke over the clay-ridden horizon. The sun is setting, I'll make camp for the night and make that tomorrow's first mission.
