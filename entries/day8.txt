Day ???

I don't know how many days I've been travelling. Hours turned into days. Days turned into weeks. Weeks turned into months. Sand. It was all sand.

I've been attacked by Mummies, Pirates, black figures in the water, Whoever "Kex the Mean" was. I'm sick of sand. I never want to see another grain of sand again.

I've found a place without sand. This will be my new home.
