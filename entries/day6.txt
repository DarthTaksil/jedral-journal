Day 6

I was awoken out of my slumber with the sound of wood grinding on wood.  I pulled my head up to see that my boat was lodged into the wreckage of a greater ship.
There were a few barrels where I found some Iron Armaments and something titled "Sacred Scroll of Regeneration." I'll study these scrolls over the next few days and see if I can glean anything from them.

As I sat on the shipwrecked ballasts I smelled smoke.  I took a look around and up the rocky shoreline I saw a glimpse of another Green Tent. I'll wait until dawn comes before making my treck up the mountain.

Dawn came, I climbed the mountain, a Zombie and four spiders were inside the tent. I left them be and continued North.

My parchment is running low, these entries may become fewer.
