Day 4
	
	As I approached the smoke I found a Green tent beside a campfire.
	As I looked inside the tent I found two Pigs standing on two feet holding Shovels.
	They were standing next to a table that looked to be used for archiology.
	In this heat I can only think of one thing: How do I leave?
	These Pigs may have a stronger willpower than I.
	
	I found a large Archway made of Red Rock.
	That's about it, thought it was neat.
	
	I see a village with some smoke billowing over. I hope there are people here.
	I've been talking to my Stone Axe for the last four days and it's terribly racist.
	
	They're witches. 
	I dated one in highschool and I'm not about to go into a group of 30 of them.
	I'll take my chances out here with the Jumbo Rabbits.
	
	I reached another Ocean. I'm sick of sand, I'm sick of being hot, I'm a pirate now.
	
	I approached another ship on the sea.
	As I got closer a Chicken lept from the side of the ship.
	He spoke. "I am an Evil Chicken" and then proceeded to throw giant black balls at me.
	I didn't stick around to carry on the conversation.
	
	After sailing for hours through cliff faces and rocky overhangs, I found a village along the shoreline.
	After finding the remains of a Wood Chopping Block I knew I could find the town hall.
	If I can do that I can learn what happened to this place.
	
	I spent the better part of the day exploring this ruined village.
	I found two woodcutting buildings, a Mine, a Warehouse, and what I would expect is used as a mailroom.
	I'll sleep in the Warehouse tonight.
