Day 1:

	I started my adventure in a grand canyon.
	I found a river north and started travelling to find the best location to start my new colony.
	
	A few hours before dusk I stumbled upon a ruined village.
	I cut down a few trees, used a nearby cave for some cobblestone.
	I grabbed a few remaining supplies from the old houses. I don't think whoever lived here will be needing them.
	Then I made my camp north off the fringes of the town.
	
	Tomorrow I'll continue to venture North in my quest of starting my new colony.
